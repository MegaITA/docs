Most common issues and how to solve them. Before scrolling through this guide there are a few things to ALWAYS check before.

- Make sure you installed all the dependencies and started them before mega_doctorjob. You can find the list in the Tebex Store or in the Discord channel dedicated to the script.

### Cannot open the Medical UI
- If you restarted the game while online:
	- If you're on a dev environment you can use /dload, otherwise do a full restart instead.
- If you get an error in console like `attempt to index a nil value`:
	- The player you're inspecting doesn't have the data loaded. It could be because you have restarted the script while online.
  - Make sure to have all the configured hospitals in the database too.

### Cannot use `/inspect` command
- The player must be dead.
- Check for inspect jobs permissions, they are different from the medic ones.

### For RSG Users
RSG-Core has an on/off duty system.
- You can ask for an edited file on my discord that ignores the on/off duty for job checking.
- You can set in the RSG Config the on-duty state by default when a player joins.
 
### Other
- Make sure to select the right adapter in the config.
