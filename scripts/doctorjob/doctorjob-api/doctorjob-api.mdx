title: 'Doctorjob API'
---

This is the place you'll find all the info about Doctorjob API's. At the current state it's only supported a client side version of the API, eventually in the future if requested I'll make a serverside version, even though still some things will need to be done on the client side.

## Client API
### Usage
```lua
local clientAPI = exports['mega_doctorjob'].ClientAPI()
```

### Methods

- `getBodyExternalTemperature(ped, localTemperature)`
	**Parameters:** PedID and localTemperature in degrees.
	**Returns:** Ped temperature according to what is wearing and external temperature.
  **Example:**
	```lua
    local coords = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())
    ShouldUseMetricTemperature()
    local localTemperature = GetTemperatureAtCoords(coords.x, coords.y, coords.z)
    local temperature = clientAPI.getBodyExternalTemperature(PlayerPedId(), localTemperature)
	```

- `getDiseases()`
	 **Returns:** table containing all ped diseases along with their data (even the non-active ones)

- `getDisease(diseaseID)`
	**Parameters:** diseaseID (for example: bleeding, brokenBone...)
	**Returns:** disease table

- `healDisease(diseaseID)`
	Completely heals the specified disease to the player
	**Parameters:** diseaseID (for example: bleeding, brokenBone...)

- `giveDisease(diseaseID)`
	Gives the specified disease to the player
	**Parameters:** diseaseID (for example: bleeding, brokenBone...)

### Classes

#### Disease
**Properties:**
- `data`: table containing all the data of the disease, can differ between different diseases but generally it is composed like this:
	- `active`: boolean, whether the disease is active or not.
	- `paused`: boolean, whether the disease is paused or not. When it's paused the symptoms will not show completely, used for bandage and temporary medicines.
	- Other stuff may vary between different diseases (examples are: `bone`, `damageType` and so on). Feel free, if you're creating your own disease, to use it as a state storage for the disease. Remember that `data` is also persistent, it gets saved to the DB and loaded on script's start.

- `_data`: proxy table used for automatic syncing of data between client and server, use this when you have to set a new state or data value and you want it synced with the server (***generally always***). However it cannot be converted to JSON or iterated, that's why `data` is still accessible.

- `config`: disease's disease.lua config that gets loaded when the disease is initialized, useful to access disease configuration.

- `name`: same as diseaseID, used from the DiseaseManager for it's initialization.
