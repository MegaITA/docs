 The file is still named infected.lua due to the scripts' initial name. However the correct name would be entities.lua.

## StateBags

Entities spawned by mega_entities will have some StateBag values associated to detect which kind of entity type they are and which chunk / zone they belong to depending on the spawn strategy that spawned them.

So far the values that you can find inside an entity spawned by mega entities are those:
```lua
entityType: string -- represents the entity type

-- If spawned with zone strategy
zoneID?: string -- (optional) refers to the zoneID in which they spawned

-- If spawned with worldgrid strategy
chunkRow?: number -- (optional) refers to the chunkRow in which they spawned
chunkCol?: number -- (optional) refers to the chunkCol in which they spawned
```

To fetch those values you can do the following:

Client-Side:
```lua
Entity(entityID).state['entityType'] -- for example: "militia"
```

Server-Side:
```lua
-- Safe way to get entityID since netID never changes
-- but entityID could change for the same entity during time
local entityID = NetworkGetEntityFromNetworkId(netID)
Entity(entityID).state['entityType']
```

## Configuration parameters

- displayName: Display name shown in the PROMPT LOCK ON action (holding right mouse button).
- model: Entity ped model
- group: Group tag for the entity check (groups page)[./scripts/entities/configuration/groups] for more info

## Example entity
Let's say we wanted to create a new entity. This entity is a militia man, it will attack infects and attack only hostile players.

Let's edit the entity types config together:
```lua
Config.EntityTypes = {
    -- other entities...
        ['militia'] = {
        displayName = "Militia",
        model = `s_m_m_army_01`,
        group = `militia`,
        scale = 1.0,
        outfits = nil, 
        maxHealth = 250,
        walkStyle = nil,
        accuracy = 90,
        seeingRange = 30.0,
        hearingRange = 30.0,
        combatAbility = 2,
        combatMovement = 2,
        combatAttributes = {
            [58] = true,
            [46] = true,
            [50] = true,
            [125] = true,
            [54] = true,
            [116] = true,
            [91] = true,
            [114] = true,
        },
        -- weapon equipment
        equipment = {
            ['weapon_rifle_springfield'] = 50
        },
        lootProbability = 0.2,
        lootTable = {
            ['ammorifleexpress'] = {
                itemId = 'ammorifleexpress',
                displayName = 'Ammo Rifle Express',
                minQuantity = 5,
                maxQuantity = 10,
                probability = 1.0,
                metadata = nil,
            },
        }
    },
}
```

## Entity config parameters

Let's talk about each of these parameters:
### displayName
Type: string  
Display name for the entity, it will be shown in prompts, etc.

### model
Type: hash  
Model hash, a list can be found [here](https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/blob/master/peds/peds_list.lua).

### group
Type: hash  
Group hash, refer to the groups guide for more info.

### scale
Type: number  
Ped scale for size.

### outfits
Type: table  
If set to `nil`, it will choose a random ped outfit across all the vanilla ones. Otherwise, you can pass a list with the outfit "numbers" you want to allow.

### maxHealth
Type: number  
Max health that the entity will have.

### walkStyle
Type: string  
The entity walk style. If set to `nil`, the default one will be preserved. You can find a list [here](https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/blob/110a7b14ffaf3eac038322bb229b90c299be4975/discoveredNatives/discovered_natives_by_community#L41).

### accuracy
Type: number  
Ped's shooting accuracy from 0-100.

### seeingRange
Type: number  
Ped's sight detection range.

### hearingRange
Type: number  
Ped's hearing detection range.

### combatAbility
Type: number  
Ped's combat ability from 0 to 2.

### combatMovement
Type: number  
Ped's combat movement type from 0 to 3.
- 0 -> Stationary (Will just stand in place)
- 1 -> Defensive (Will try to find cover and very likely to blind fire)
- 2 -> Offensive (Will attempt to charge at enemy but take cover as well)
- 3 -> Suicidal Offensive (Will try to flank enemy in a suicidal attack)

### combatAttributes
Type: table
Ped's combat attributes, in the key part [xxx] there will be the combat attribute we want to enable or disable (true/false). You can find a list (here)[https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/tree/master/AI/COMBAT_ATTRIBUTES]

### equipment
Type: table
Ped's equipment, these are the weapons the ped will be carrying, and the ammo that they have.
Example: `['weapon'] = ammoQuantity`

### lootProbability
Type: number
Ped's probability to spawn loot when killed

### lootTable
Type: table
Ped's loot table, it's defined in the following format:
```lua
['exampleItem'] = {
    itemId = 'exampleItem',
    -- used for displaying which item you got in the notifications
    displayName = 'Example Item', 
    minQuantity = 1,
    maxQuantity = 5,
    probability = 1.0,
    metadata = nil
}
```
If the item will spawn then a random quantity will be chosen between the minQuantity and maxQuantity range.  Metadata can be used for specific frameworks allowing metadata suppport.
