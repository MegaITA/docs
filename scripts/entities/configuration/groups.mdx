## Entity Groups
An entity group is basically a *tag* you can apply on entities. It will be used in this file to determine the relationships between entity groups. Making them aggressive or peaceful towards other groups.

You can also use default game groups which can be found (here)[https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/tree/master/AI/RELATIONSHIP#list-of-default-relationship-groups].

## Relationship Levels
Groups can have relationships between them, telling the game how their AI should behave when encountering other entities.

A list of relationship groups can be found (here)[https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/tree/master/AI/RELATIONSHIP#list-of-relation-types].

## Example of configuration
Let's say we want to add a new group called `militia` which will attack another group named `infected`. Also, `infected` will attack `militia`.

```lua
Config.Groups = {
    ["infected"] = {
        [`PLAYER`] = 6,
        [`REL_WILD_ANIMAL_PREDATOR`] = 1,
        ["militia"] = 6 -- define new relationship level with the `militia` group.
    },
    -- new militia group
    ["militia"] = {
        ["infected"] = 6, -- define relationship level with `infected` group.
    }
}
```
